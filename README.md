# Hotel-Booking Cancellation Prediction
This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as customer demographics, booking details, and hotel characteristics, the model identifies patterns that contribute to cancellations. This insight helps hotel management make informed decisions to minimize cancellations and improve revenue.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data distributions and relationships to uncover insights.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Model Building: Implements supervised learning models, including XGBoost, for accurate cancellation predictions.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model performance using techniques like Randomized Search.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model effectiveness.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
